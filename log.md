# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: March 27, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Completed the "Basic HTML and HTML5" and "Basic CSS" courses under the "Responsive Web Design" certification on freecodcamp.org to brush up on my basics.

**Thoughts:** I'm excited and I want be able to start creating as soon as I'm done brushing up the basics. It'll take time to get to a certain level, but it's all going to be worth it at the end. My plant took half a month to grow a leaf. It worked so hard to reach at a point where it's growth could be visible. I'm going to work hard too! :seedling:
